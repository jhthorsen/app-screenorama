NAME
    App::screenorama - Application output to websocket stream

VERSION

DESCRIPTION
    This program allow you to pipe STDOUT and STDERR from a program over a
    websocket.

  Protocol
    The data transmitted over the websocket connection is JSON in each
    frame:

    *   Startup

          {"program":$str,"program_args":...}

        Same as "program" and "program_args".

    *   Output

          {"output":$str}

        Comes after each time the program emit data. NOTE: There's no
        guaranty that it will be emitted on newline.

    *   Exit

          {"exit_value":$int,"signal":$int}

        The exit value of the application. The websocket will be closed
        after you see this.

    *   Error

          {"error":$str}

        If something goes wrong with the application or other operating
        system errors.

SYNOPSIS
  Server
      # let others connect to the running program
      $ screenorama daemon --listen http://*:5000 -- 'while sleep 1; do echo "hey!"; done'

      # pipe the output on incoming request
      $ screenorama daemon -- ls -l

      # Set parameters from config file
      $ MOJO_CONFIG=/path/to/config.pl screenorama daemon

    Supported config/environment variables:

    *   conduit

    *   program

        The application to run.

    *   program_args
